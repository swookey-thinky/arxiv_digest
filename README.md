# Arxiv Digest

I've needed a better way to triage new research published on Arxiv, so I present [Arxiv Digest](https://arxiv-digest.vercel.app/). By default, it will show you the papers published in the last day using a default query (Language Modeling in this case). You can add tags to help you triage different papers, filter by tags to see only the papers with those tags, click through to the paper on arxiv, setup custom queries, and search by keyword or title. It uses Google for authentication, and the only reason its a logged in experience is to remember the tags you have created for each paper, and any custom search queries you have saved.

I built this for myself, but if you have any issues or requests feel free to post them here. Would be nice to make it useful to other people.

## Fun Fact

This website was entirely created with [Bolt](https://bolt.new). It's pretty freaking cool.
